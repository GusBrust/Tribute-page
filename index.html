            "There is no one who has believed in God and the kingdom of God,
            there is no one who has heard of the kingdom of the resurrected
            and does not feel, from then on, an immense longing for home,
            a joyful anticipation for the liberation from bodily existence [...].
            If our faith does not transform it, death is hell,
            it is night and cold. But this is precisely what is wonderful,
            the fact that we can transform death."

            <span>Dietrich Bonhoeffer, in a sermon preached in London, November 1933</span>
